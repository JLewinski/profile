Jacob Lewinski Senior Software Engineer Huntsville, Alabama, United
States

Summary

I am an experienced software developer specialized in building web
applications that enhance the lives of the others. I have a strong
foundation with years of experience using ASP.NET Core MVC with vanilla
JS. Recently, I have helped multiple projects grow by modernizing the
tech stack to include a frontend framework like Svelte and React. I have
enjoyed experimenting with different technologies and the differences in
performance and developer experience.
